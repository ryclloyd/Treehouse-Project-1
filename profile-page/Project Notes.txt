- BACKGROUND - 
Iâ€™m a established professional with over 20 years experience in client-focused roles and operational management. The majority of my career was been spent with e-commerce and service start-ups, where I adapted and learned the valuable skills needed to wear multiple hats to get the job done. Part of which was working directly with developement teams to plan and build proprietary systems, website maintanence, and new site functionality. Eventaully moving towards more client-facing roles.
 
Prior to jumping into my business career my intended professional direction was to graphic design and web development. I've enjoyed my business expereiences, working with clients and problem-solving, but for a number of years have been longing to do something creative again.


- GOALS -
I'm working towards completing the Front-end Web Development bootcamp at Treehouse to start my new career path. A caree in the tech field requires continuely bettering your skills and knowledge, which I would focus on Javascript and React. During which time I plan to do some freelance work and learn UX and UI.
